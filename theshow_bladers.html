Ray may be quiet, but beneath his low-key demeanor he
is incredibly confident. Ray always looks before he leaps, especially when it comes to Beyblade Battles.  
Ray met the Bladebreakers after battling in a tournament as a member of the White Tigers team. After being totally awestruck by the opposition, Ray decided to jump ship and join the Bladebreakers, and also gained a true and loyal friend in Tyson. This time around, Ray wants to prove himself against Tyson in the World Championship Tournament, and the way to accomplish that is to beat Tyson in the finals. Ray reunites with his old teammates and goes on to form the White Tigers X team.

Rick was raised in a in a pretty rough neighbourhood where, everyone tried their best to make a decent life for themselves. Rick chose the way of the Beyblade, and making it to the World Championships was one way of setting a great example. At first he is mistaken as a person who feels that working with a partner is unnecessary to win Beybattles. Rick later comes to the realization that no one Beyblader can be as powerful as many working together as a team. He also carries his stereo around whenever he Beybattles. It provides him with extra motivation, and also tends to distract his opponents.

Being the 'older' sister, Julia is usually the one bossing her brother around and giving the orders. Being trained by Romero from a very young age, both Raul and Julia have an uncanny ability to work together as a team. The downside to this is that most of the techniques that they use in the Beystadium mirror each other, so that when they aren't battling together, they can be fairly predictable. <br><br>

Brooklyn is a brilliant Beyblader. He Beyblades like it involves no skill or effort at all, going as far as making it look easy. But, such raw talent made it unnecessary for him to pay his usual dues and as a byproduct, made it difficult to make many friends.  When Brooklyn battles against opponents that are not up to his skill level, he often displays an unenthusiastic attitude. Brooklyn does not make any extravagant attacks, instead he just waits until his opponents run out of spin on their own. However, if Brooklyn ever finds himself losing a battle, his uncanny talent somehow harnesses negative energy in such a way that it creates a black hole. <br><br>

Garland comes from a family of professional athletes. His oldest brother is a major league baseball player as well as a Triple Crown winner. His older brother is a Formula 1 champion driver for two consecutive years. His sister is a tennis player who won the championship tournament at Wimbledon. Garland chooses his path as a top Beyblader, to prove himself as his brothers and sister have already done. For this reason he joins the ranks of the BEGA league, with the hope that he can one day be as famous as his siblings. Garland's battle style is to endure his opponent's attacks first and then evaluate before he counterattacks. <br><br>

Crusher was struggling in poverty before he joined BEGA. His main goal was to help his sister receive the medical attention that she needs. Crusher started to Beyblade much later in life than most Blader's, but his desire to help his sister gave him the edge to becoming a fantastic Beyblader. Crusher aspires to become a professional Beyblader and make a living with it. With his kind heart, he sometimes comes off as a big, dangerous teddy bear. <br><br>

This Blader literally floats like a butterfly, and can sting like a bee. Mystel has an unusual ability to defy gravity, or so it seems. This surprising newcomer seems to have appeared out of nowhere, and has more than proved himself worthy of being a professional Beyblader. His attacks are swift, and not easily predicted. <br><br>

Being the poster girl for the BEGA league can have its perks. This teen idol provides entertainment in the form of singing the praises of the BEGA organization. Don't let this fool you though, because she is also a top notch Beyblader. She also uses her singing to help her concentration during a match, as well as to distract her opponents. <br><br>
