Just as he begins his session, a cocky kid comes down from the hills and challenges Tyson to a battle.  His name is Daichi and the battle begins with the challenger going for the jugular and has put the champ in a real spot!  And what's worse, Daichi's blade copycats Tyson's every move, stealing power from him as the battle progresses!
But it's Tyson who finally wins the battle by calling out his Galaxy Storm.  Daichi is humiliated and begs Tyson for another battle.  Tyson has had enough of this strange little twerp and is about to walk away, when…out of the blue, another character appears- Jin of the Gale!  Now Tyson is facing another challenger who wants to strip our hero of his world championship title!!"

Just as they’re about to battle another mysterious Blader named Jin shows up and wants to challenge Tyson as well. All three Bladers mix it up but Ray puts a stop to the fight when he realizes that Tyson can’t handle two Bladers at once. Across town Mr. Dickenson calls a press conference to inform all Bladers that the World Championships will begin again but this year there will be an interesting twist. Tag teams will represent the final teams in the championships. This news causes a stir throughout the city and the Bladebreakers are very excited, especially Tyson. Unfortunately Ray and Max don’t share Tyson’s enthusiasm for the new tag team rules of the tournament. They decide to leave the Blade Breakers and represent their hometown teams. Tyson is shocked by this news and confronts his friends but reluctantly agrees to let them go!”</p>

Nobody thinks anything when a fan named Kotaro asks for an autograph and takes advantage of the opportunity to examine Tyson, Kenny and Daichi's Beyblades.  But when he shows up as competitor and defeats Kenny with the Chameleon Fake, everyone is alarmed.  Does Kotaro's Chameleon Bey have the ability to copy attacks as well as colors and will this spell defeat for Tyson?</p>

When Daichi finds out it's a tag team event and he's not going to go up against Tyson, he's totally enraged, but decides to beat Kai anyway.  Meanwhile, the mysterious Jin is lurking around the dressing room listening in on our hero's conversations. When the finals in Block B begin, a radical jungle dish is revealed which gives Daichi the edge.  Quickly, the underdog starts slamming and attacking Kai while Kai does nothing to defend himself.  As Tyson and his friends watch, they nervously yell out for to attack, but Kai doesn't listen.  Suddenly, as if struck by a bolt of lightening, Kai calls out for his Dranzer to attack!  In one swoop, he destroys Daichi.  After the battle, Kai is announced as Tyson's partner for the Tag Team Finals, but Mr. Dickenson makes an announcement that their new team, the BBA Revolution, will have two alternate players-  Daichi and Kenny!  And the announcement is made by Jin!!  But that's not the only surprise!  It turns out Jin is actually Hiro, Tyson's older brother who's come back to coach Tyson and his team!!"</p>

When they first arrive, Hiro tells Tyson that Kai has quit the team. Tyson is ready to quit to, but Hiro convinces him to choose a new partner. Tyson picks Daichi, then whisks him off into the wilderness to teach him survival skills as they relate to Beyblading. The plan works well until Tyson strays from the main path, and gets himself and Daichi hopelessly lost. From there it's one disaster after another:  They fall in the river, lose all their equipment, and eventually get trapped by a raging forest fire.  Only by working together, and using their Beyblades in perfect unison, can they save themselves and the forest. Of course that's easier said then done when it comes to Tyson and Daichi.  In the end, however, they get the job done...and Tyson realizes that Daichi does in fact have what it takes to be his partner in the championship tournament.</p>

Tyson meanwhile, exhibits his first real sympathy for his diminutive teammate, and vows to go easier on him.

There, they find the boy who robbed them using Dragoon to battle Rick of the PPB All Starz in a street match. Rick wins and prepares to leave with his stolen bounty. Tyson and Daichi try to convince Rick to give back their blades, but Rick will only return them if they defeat him in a match. The three bladers engage in battle, with Tyson and Daichi tag-teaming Rick. Rick is on the verge of defeating them when a surprise fourth blader jumps in - Max. The match ends in a draw, and Rick leaves empty-handed. Max vows to try and improve his relationship with Rick, who's his PPB All Starz teammate. Back at their Hotel, the BBA Revolution team watch the sports news on TV, and learn that the other teams in the Championship Tournament have all arrived in New York City. But the most shocking news, is that a surprise addition has been made to the mysterious Blitzkrieg Boys team - their former teammate Kai.</p>

Tyson is insulted to the core...even more so when Ray chooses to let Lee face-off against Tyson in the first match, White Tiger X versus BBA Revolution! In an attempt to prove his worth, Tyson makes an arrogant demand: he insists on 'blading the two White Tiger X team members at the same time!

Unfortunately, Barthez's personality slips through on occasion revealing the truth about how much a tyrant he really is.   The Italian tournament begins and it's Barthez Battalion against White Tiger X.  Ray starts for the Tigers going up against Claude.  In mere seconds, Ray pulls off a victory that sets off alarm bells among the other competitors who think something is fishy.  The second battle has Lee and Miguel pitted against each other.  It doesn't take long for Miguel to win the match for Barthez Battallion which sets up the third and final round-  Miguel against Ray!  This battle starts off with Ray on the offensive, but suddenly, blades spring out of Miguel's blade and KABOOM! Miguel wins!  Kenny, watching this on a monitor, is very suspicious of the victory just as Hiro enters to give the line-up for the next battle... which doesn't include Tyson.</p>

Daichi wins his match and Kenny nervously goes to the beystadium to face his opponent Tala. During the battle, Kenny finds himself way out of his league but when Tala starts to insult Tyson he discovers his blading spirit and vows to never give up and win the match for his friend!"</p>

<img src="images/tv/ep116.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">In the second of a best of three match, Tala thinks he's broken Kenny down, but Kenny summons his inner strength and attacks with all of his combined power.  Unfortunately, it's not enough, and Tala shatters Kenny's Hopper into pieces with his Novae Rog attack.  Kenny loses the match, but in the process spots a major weakness in Tala's game. Daichi is called to take on Tala in the tie-breaker. Tyson is desperate for the win, and tries to convince Tala to let him fight in Daichi's place. Tala refuses, and Daichi is furious that Tyson has so little faith in his abilities.  Meanwhile, Kenny rigs Daichi's Beyblade with a special part to help him in the battle. He convinces Daichi to follow his game plan, and stay away from Tala's 'blade until the perfect moment. Daichi agrees, but it goes against his natural style and it takes all his strength just to keep from attacking. Finally Kenny spots the opening, and Daichi takes advantage. Daichi defeats Tala, and the BBA Revolution is awarded the victory. Tyson is humbled, and vows never to underestimate his teammates again.</p>

<p class=headline>Epsiode 117 : SLEEPLESS IN MADRID<br><img src="images/bar_1px.gif" alt="" width="634" height="1" border="0" vspace="5"><br></p>
<img src="images/tv/ep117.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">In Madrid for the Spanish leg of the World Championships, the hard-of-sleeping Lee has a nightmare that Ray kicks him off the team for his poor play. The day before their next match, White Tiger X encounters a pair of beyblading jugglers in Madrid's main square, who also happen to be trick bladers. When Lee criticizes their performance, he and Ray are challenged to an impromptu match. The jugglers beat them handily, which only exacerbates Lee's insecurity about his skills. Ray suspects that Lee's problem stems not only from a lack of sleep lately, but from a lack of communication between the two. Ray discusses the problem with Tyson, who suggests that Ray be more confrontational. Mr. Dickenson meanwhile, ponders whether to grant F Dynasty their request for a two-on-two match. Turns out it was Raul and Julia of F Dynasty who posed as the street jugglers in order to goad Lee and Ray. When the day of the match arrives, and White Tiger X faces F Dynasty, Lee and Ray discover the jugglers' true identities. Wanting payback for their earlier loss, Lee and Ray accept the two-on-two challenge and the match format is set. F Dynasty dominates the contest, causing Lee to go batty in fear of letting Ray down yet again. Coming loose at the seams, Lee's reckless blading becomes a serious concern. To save his fragile-minded teammate from further distress, Ray knocks out Lee's blade himself and accept his team's loss. Discussing the incident afterward, Lee acknowledges his mistake, and he and Ray vow to be more communicative in the future.</p>

It turns out Barthez Battalion won their qualifying tournament through trickery.

Armed with his new Draciel Gravity, Max takes Kai to the edge of defeat only to end up defeated himself.  Rick uses his frustration at the loss to overcome Tala and goes on to face Kai in a tiebreaker.  Despite his great power, Rick loses to the more experienced Kai.

But as Barthez readies his team, we learn he's devised a special spider web-like tape that is supposed to shoot out of his team's blades and trap their opponents in an inescapable web.  Miguel is torn and knows that if they follow his coach's plan they could win, but he feels he'd rather lose with respect than cheat.  In the first battle, Aaron goes up against Tala.  Barthez tells his players to just act natural and he would operate the spider webbing by remote control.  As the battle begins, Barthez desperately pushes the remote control, but nothing happens.  Turns out Aaron refused to use the 'fixed' blade.  Barthez is furious.  Miguel is defiant and tell Barthez that they aren't going to be 'his puppets anymore.'  As Barthez leaves, Miguel steps into the ring against Kai.  The battle doesn't last very long as Kai wins handily.  But Miguel has lost with dignity and that's just the way he wants it!</p>

<img src="images/tv/ep122.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">The Egyptian leg of the World Championships culminates with the final match highlighting F Dynasty against the BBA Revolution. The day before the match, Tyson has Daichi practice moves with him that they're not usually accustomed to doing: namely, tag-team attacks. F Dynasty is renowned for their tag-team abilities, and Tyson wants nothing more than to beat them at their own game. He knows this will be a challenge, as F Dynasty has already used the tag-team format to defeat White Tiger X earlier in the tournament. But as the former Beyblade world champion, Tyson feels it's his duty to prove that he's the best, no matter what the format is. F Dynasty meanwhile, foregoes practicing in favor of another fantastic street show of their beyblading skills for a crowd of onlookers. In a flashback to their childhood, we learn that Raul and Julia have been performing as a duo since their formative years growing up in the circus. The introduction of beyblades to their act only solidified their skills. When the day of the match arrives, Tyson specifically requests the two-on-two format and F Dynasty agrees. The sand-filled Sahara dish gives Tyson and Daichi the pre-battle advantage, but during the match, Tyson's beyblade has trouble keeping up. Coach Hiro realizes that the pressure Tyson is feeling to carry his team as the former Beyblade champion is affecting his performance. But this realization comes too late. Raul and Julia pull off another spectacular tag-team assault and defeat Tyson and Daichi. This results in an unusual predicament. All teams remaining in World Championship tournament now stand at two wins and two losses - meaning none of them have been eliminated yet</p>

Despite Hiro's warning, a television crew follows him around for a day, taping his every move.  Daichi feels jealous and tries to compete for the camera's attention.  Finally, BBA Revolution holds a three-way match between Tyson, Daichi and Kenny for the cameras and Tyson loses like an amateur.  Tyson contemplates quitting and wanders to the Beystadium to be alone with his thoughts.  Daichi confronts him and challenges him to a match.  During the beybattle, Tyson is reminded of how it feels to beyblade for the pure love of the game.  The pressure disappears when Tyson realizes he doesn't have to beyblade like a champion. He just has to beyblade like himself!  Tyson meets Kai, Max and Ray ands tells them that, from now on, they are all challengers and any one of them could end up as champion.</p>

Feeling like the weak link of the team, Raul surprises Julia by insisting he battle solo for F Dynasty, in order to prove his worth.  Julia reluctantly agrees. In the first match Julia easily defeats Miguel, piling even more pressure on Raul. Raul is up against Mathilda of Barthez Battalion (who is using a combination of parts from her team's Beyblades) in the second match. Raul freezes under the pressure, and it looks like he is a sitting duck.  But Julia steps in to explain to Raul that the only reason she has so much confidence in battle is because she has him at her side.  This fires Raul up, and he battles back to steal the victory.  The Barthez Battalion team are eliminated, but they are very gracious in defeat.</p>

The first battle sees Daichi playing against Rick.  Daichi seems a little over confident going into battle as his sights are set on the bigger prize, fighting in the finals with Tyson.  Rick on the other hand is more realistic.  He understands where he comes from and that he's lucky to be where he is, yet he too wants to get this battle behind him. The fight is a tough one.  In fact, the combatants are going at it so hard that the entire arena is filled with the acrid smell of burnt metal.  This seems to be a battle of wills rather than blades as each Blader attempts to summon every ounce of power that they can.  In the end, Daichi proves to be the winner, and Rick is devastated. Daichi on the other hand has used so much energy that he passes out.  Now it's time for the next round, and it pits Tyson against his former teammate, Max!</p>

When he goes in for the final hit, Max suddenly goes on the offense and starts Draciel's engine gear. Just when it looks like Dragoon is going to be knocked out Tyson cleverly uses Draciel's own power against it and defeats Max!

Only two teams can play in the finals, and a format to determine which ones will compete must be decided. Will they stage a mini-round robin tournament between the three teams? Or will the BBA Revolution and F Dynasty, who are both tied for second place battle, with the winner moving on to face the Blitzkrieg Boys in the finals? These questions will all take time to answer - time the various competitors use to catch up with family members. With the PPB All Starz eliminated from the tournament, Max visits his folks and then drops by the local community center where he and Ray first told Tyson they were leaving the Bladebreakers. Tyson goes home to visit Grandpa, and Daichi tags along, making himself a little too at home in the process. Grandpa is impressed by Tyson's newfound seriousness when it comes to his martial arts training. Coach Romero of F Dynasty gives Raul and Julia a surprise when he brings them to visit the circus, which just happens to be in town. The circus is where the siblings grew up, and a heartfelt reunion ensues. At BBA Headquarters, Mr. Dickenson announces the finals format. The two second place teams will indeed face each other first, with the victor getting to advance. Tyson surprises everyone by requesting that his match be a tag-team battle. Kenny gives Tyson his newly created Dragoon Galaxy Turbo, an improved version of Dragoon, which performs well in tag-team practice. Tyson and Daichi are pumped - they couldn't be more ready for their upcoming rematch against F Dynasty</p>

Kai wants them to be evenly matched so that he won't have any advantage in battle.Because of the power levels involved, Mr. Dickenson unveils a new stadium dish, hidden under the floor of the main stadium. It is a square mile large, and in the style of an outdoor environment. Tyson is used to more traditional indoor stadium designs, but feels he is up for the challenge. Tyson begins to draw on the skills he learned from his previous battles, while Kai's focus is on his exceptional abilities and his single-minded desire to be the best. The battle rages on...</p>

He decides the only way he can get the respect he deserves is to go on a training mission and come back and defeat Tyson on his own. He hitches a ride on a truck and falls asleep but wakes up far away from home, alone and hungry. Luckily he runs into Max and his father who invite him back to their house for dinner. During the meal Max squirts mustard on Daichi's steak telling him it will make it taste better. This disgusts Daichi, and in his anger he insults Max and his father. Max takes offense and challenges Daichi to a Beyblade battle. The match is a close one and Daichi is confident he can beat Max but he was beaten by Max's strength. He decides that the only way he can become a better Blader is to start training with Max. Meanwhile Tyson discovers Daichi gone and wonders why and where his Blading partner has gone.</p>

<img src="images/tv/ep134.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">A news bulletin announces that the BBA has been bought and transformed into a new, professional league, named the BEGA League and that Mr. Dickenson has resigned from his position as Chairman. The kids go off in search of their old friend and demand an explanation. Ashamed, Mr. Dickenson reveals that the board of the BBA had completed the plans to sell the league while he was occupied with the World Championships. Tyson resolves to show up at the press conference the next day and discover who is behind the plot. But at the press conference, he is faced with the new singing sensation, Ming-Ming who announces that not only is she the official mascot of the BEGA League but also its top ranked professional Beyblader. Tyson challenges her to Beybattle and Ming-Ming accepts under the condition that Tyson beat her entire Ming-Ming Band. Will Tyson, Max and Daichi be able to beat the Beybattling band and face off against an old foe?</p>

<p class=headline>Epsiode 135 : OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE<br><img src="images/bar_1px.gif" alt="" width="634" height="1" border="0" vspace="5"><br></p>
<img src="images/tv/ep135.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">Tyson, Max, Kenny and Daichi are invited by Boris to take a tour inside his new BEGA headquarters. Hilary isn't allowed inside until the official public opening, and is sent away, much to her chagrin. The boys find that the BEGA building is unparalleled in the quality of its Beyblade training and facilities. Impressive as it is however, Tyson is still highly distrustful of Boris, who was responsible for trying to take over the world two years ago by using his team the Demolition Boys as soldiers. Boris tries to convince Tyson that he's changed. Ever since his scheme was uncovered, he roamed throughout his homeland doing some soul searching. There, while watching some village children Beyblade, he had an epiphany. He realized that Beyblading is all about honor and individuality, and he made it his new goal to bring Beyblading to the masses. That's why he took over the BBA and turned it into BEGA - as a way to give children around the world that had no exposure to the game a chance to better their lives and become champions themselves. Tyson is still skeptical, and his bad-mouthing of Boris draws the ire of a top BEGA prospect - a juggernaut named Crusher, whose Beyblade launcher is the biggest one the boys have ever seen. When grilled by Tyson about his motives for joining this professional league, Crusher admits he's doing it for the prospect of getting rich, but only so he can afford to pay his younger sister's hospital bills. A Beybattle ensues, and Crusher shows he's even more powerful than he looks. Tyson is nearly defeated, but he summons his will and narrowly defeats his jumbo-sized opponent. When Boris asks Tyson if he now believes he's sincere in his reasons for creating BEGA, Tyson still isn't sure. But Tyson does admit that if spirited and honorable Blader's like Crusher are in it, maybe there is some merit in the new league after all.</p>

It isn't long until the entire team meets up with him again, and Ray comes face to face with the stranger's incredible abilities like leaping, flying and jumping through the air, not to mention Beyblading like a world champion. He calls himself Mystel and amazes Lee and Ray with the mixture of his incredible acrobatics and Beyblading skills. Lee imagines how good the White Tiger X team would be if they knew how to move like Mystel, and, after challenging their new guest to a battle, has high hopes that he'll share his secrets. But Lee is humiliated by a quick loss, and now it's up to Ray to represent the team in it's own backyard! Can he beat Mystel, and more importantly, can he find out the secrets behind this mysterious young Beyblader?</p>

When the team is visited by a rabid pack of sponsors who want to sign them to product contracts, Grandpa is forced to step in and recommend that Tyson have a talk with his more experienced brother, Hiro. While looking for Hiro, Tyson and friends come across Tala, Bryan and Spencer, who are on their way to get revenge on Boris by bringing the BEGA league down around him. Tyson is torn between following Tala, and respecting Tala's wish that he stay out of it.  At BEGA headquarters, Tala, Spencer, and Bryan confront Boris and demand to face his top Beyblader's. Boris accepts their challenge, but puts them up against some first-level recruits instead to make them feel over-confident. After Tala and the Boys have defeated the BEGA team, Garland challenges them to a battle. Boris promises to dismantle the league if they beat Garland, but they have to join his pro league if Garland beats them. Tala refuses the deal, but Garland decides to battle anyway as a point of pride. Tyson and the gang arrive just in time to see Garland destroy Bryan and Spencer in a two-on-one battle. Now it's Tala's turn...</p>

Once there, they find Garland and Tala going head to head all under the supervision of Boris who observes from the wings.An intense battle is played out on the stadium floor, when, it looks like Tala is about to lose, bars rise up out of the floor and keep him in the dish. As they continue to battle, Tala becomes weaker and weaker and collapses. Tyson's had enough. He yells out at Boris telling him his whole BEGA outfit is bogus and he challenges the shadowy figure to a battle. Boris accepts the challenges and at stake is the future of the BEGA and Tyson's future as a Beyblader!! Most of Tyson's friends surround him in a show of support, except one. Kai walks out of the stands and walks right by Tyson leaving him high and dry!</p>

Worst of all, Hiro, Tyson's brother has been hired on to coach the BEGA Blader's! Tyson tells his troubles to Ray but gets no sympathy. Secretly Ray has always wanted to battle Tyson when he was at his championship best so he challenges his old friend. An intense battle ensues with Tyson eventually coming out the winner. Ray is satisfied but his blade and Tyson's is ruined. With no hope of getting replacement parts the team decides to build their own blades and go face the BEGA Blader's in battle!</p>

After meeting an exceptional Blader named Garland, Kai is warned not to go head to head with Brooklyn - the most powerful Blader at BEGA.  Even Hiro is astounded by Brooklyn's abilities.

But without an official BEGA I.D. card signifying membership in the new league - something they steadfastly refuse to get - they're shut out from getting parts at any store. Despairing about how they'll solve this dilemma, they're visited by members of various teams they fought against in the World Championships: White Tiger X, PPB All Starz, Barthez Battalion, and F Dynasty. These former foes don't like Boris and his professional BEGA league either, seeing this new entity as a threat to the sport of Beyblading. They vow to help Tyson and the other members of the BBA Revolution in whatever way they can to overthrow BEGA. Boarding a bus to the location Tyson and Daichi trained at, two questions remain unanswered. Which players from this talented assemblage will form the new five-player team to contend against BEGA's best? And can they create a new, more powerful Beyblade with which to accomplish this task? Hilary surprises all by displaying her new 'Hilary Star Flash' persona in an attempt to secure a spot on the team as a player. Her skills are lacking however, and she's relegated to helping Mr. Dickenson, Grandpa and Mr. Tate prepare food for the group. But despite Hilary's setback, Mariah, Julia and Matilda show the boys that the girls can indeed compete for one of the five player positions on the squad. Practice, battling and training is the order of the day as everyone vies for one of the coveted spots, which have yet be decided. As for the Beyblade situation, Kenny, Michael and Emily succeed in utilizing data from past battles and leftover parts to create the revolutionary new Beyblade they've been seeking - Dragoon Metal Storm.</p>

Daichi's goal is to prove that Ming Ming doesn't take Beyblading seriously and he vows to knock her out of the stadium early in the match. However, when Ming Ming gains the upper hand this makes Daichi very annoyed. Worst of all, Ming Ming has the nerve to break into song as if to mock Daichi. Even worse, her singing seems to make her Blading improve and she slams Strata Dragoon relentlessly. Kenny, a devoted fan of Ming Ming's, realizes that it's her voice that helps her concentrate on her blade and Tyson tells Daichi of her secret. Daichi uses his own voice to unleash the full power of Strata Dragoon but in the end Ming Ming proves to be the better blader and wins the match. Daichi is disappointed but being a good sportsman he congratulates Ming Ming.

<img src="images/tv/ep147.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">The first two matches of the 'Justice 5' tournament are complete, and things aren't looking good for Tyson's squad, G Revolutions. BEGA's team is up two games to one in the best-of-five series. If they lose another match, BEGA will be victorious and have complete control over the sport of Beyblading. This puts a lot of pressure on Max to win game three against Mystel. Tyson and the others argue whether Max's signature defensive style will be enough to overcome Mystel's unpredictable and overpowering attack. Max takes this as a sign that his teammates only think he can win if he changes the way he Beyblades altogether. His confidence shattered, Max isolates himself and does some soul-searching. He receives a morale boost from a unlikely source - Rick, his contentious PPB All Starz partner. Rick helps Max realize that his trademark style is what made him so successful as a Blader, and it would be foolish not to use it just because the odds are against him. Max never wanted to give up his defensive tactics in the first place, so Rick's advice only strengthens his resolve to simply do what he does best. When the time comes for his battle against Mystel, Max uses his time-tested strategies. He's quickly overwhelmed by Mystel's wild, hard-hitting attack, and defeat seems eminent. But Draciel's spectacular defense curtails the downward spiral, and the match ends in a draw. The stalemate result isn't the victory that Max desired, but it successfully postpones any chance of losing the tournament for at least one more match. For the underdog G Revolutions team, momentum has finally turned in their favor.</p>

As all of the others vie for the last spot, Kai's frustration at his lack of control with his new Hard Metal Beyblade reaches an all-time high, combine that with his anger at what happened to Tala, and Kai's mood is even less cheery than usual. It isn't until he connects with an unlikely Blading opponent that he gains the technique he's been seeking for so long...the real question is, will Tyson and the rest of the gang welcome Kai back after all they've been through in the past?</p>

Kai becomes frustrated and realizes he must dig deep within himself to draw out more power.  He does, however, it's making him weaker and weaker.

<p class=headline>Epsiode 150 : THE BEYBLADING SPIRIT<br><img src="images/bar_1px.gif" alt="" width="634" height="1" border="0" vspace="5"><br></p>
<img src="images/tv/ep150.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">The battle of "Justice 5 Tournament" continues and Kai is clearly overwhelmed by the power of Brooklyn of the Bega Bladers. Attack after attack sees Kai barely hanging on as he fights to stay in the match. Tyson and his team mates nervously watch, but vow to stay out of the battle because of a promise that Tyson made to Kai. Pleased with the progress of the battle and confident that Brooklyn will win, Boris watches from the sidelines with delight. Kai's determination to win against these unbeatable odds begins to frustrate Brooklyn and he increases the intensity of his attacks. Suddenly, when it seems that Kai can't take any more he manages to draw upon his Beyblading spirit and defeat Brooklyn. The crowd goes wild at this dramatic upset and Kai leaves the stadium only to collapse into Tyson's arms, battered and bruised. Brooklyn remains in the stadium, stunned and confused after suffering the first defeat of his Beyblading career. Kai assures his concerned team mates that he's all right and tells Tyson that he should be more concerned with his upcoming battle against Garland. Tyson, as confident as ever, shrugs Kai's advice off but secretly hopes he can summon the same amazing strength that his old friend showed in his battle. Kai walks unsteadily out of the stadium alone, collapses again, and then watches as Dranzer disintegrates in front of him.</p>

Tyson is determined to make sure Kai's brave victory over Brooklyn isn't wasted. Garland is confident he will win. His family have been sports champions for centuries thanks to a book containing the Tzebult Principles of Victory. Those who follow the principles never lose!  Tyson seeks the help of his friends to prepare, finding comfort and focus in their company. The match begins and Garland seems unbeatable due to the family principles. But Tyson isn't satisfied... he wants to fight the real Garland, not a book of rules. Tyson convinces Garland to abandon the family code and Beybattle like a true Blader.

<img src="images/tv/ep152.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">Brooklyn has gone a little loopy after his loss against Kai. And the loss means either BEGA or the G Revolutions need one more victory to win the Justice 5 Tournament. To determine a winner, one battle is left and it will pit Tyson going up against one of the BEGA Blader's. But who will it be? Garland offers his services, but Hiro turns him down cold saying they need Brooklyn to fight this battle. Brooklyn's on the brink of a breakdown and now it's up to Hiro to get him back into fighting form.Meanwhile, Boris has taken matters into his own hands and dispatches Crusher and Ming Ming to knock Tyson out before he even has a chance to battle the BEGA Blader's. Crusher and Ming Ming arrive and straight away challenge Tyson to a battle.  Rick and Lee step in to protect Tyson. At first it appears Crusher and Ming Ming are going to go through with their attack, then stop when they realize Tyson isn't their enemy. Now the stage is set for the big showdown between Tyson and Brooklyn!</p>

<img src="images/tv/ep153.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">The final match between the G Revolutions and the BEGA Bladers has arrived. Tyson prepares for the contest, unsure of whom he will ultimately face. It isn't until he steps onto the stadium floor when he discovers that he will go face to face, against Brooklyn himself. Brooklyn shows off his incredible powers immediately, stunning both teams on either side of the Beystadium. But no one has any idea of the true extent of Brooklyn's powers until he creates a wormhole to another dimension, creating an empty shell, carbon copy of the real world! The freak out continues as Brooklyn destroys everything in his new empty world to mold it into an image that makes him happy! Tyson has never faced an opponent like this! Does he stand a chance, or will BEGA continue its evil infection of the Beyblading community?</p>

<p class=headline>Epsiode 154 : BEYBATTLE FOR THE AGES<br><img src="images/bar_1px.gif" alt="" width="634" height="1" border="0" vspace="5"><br></p>
<img src="images/tv/ep154.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace"10" border="1">It's mid-way through Tyson and Brooklyn's final tie-breaking 'Justice 5' match which could give BEGA a stranglehold on the entire sport of Beyblading. Having suffered his only previous defeat at the hands of Kai, Brooklyn's thirst for revenge takes the form of an unearthly power. Not only has his Beyblade Zeus given Brooklyn sinister black wings with which to fly, it's generated a giant vortex in the sky that is wreaking havoc on the city. Buildings are crumbling everywhere. The entire world is being enveloped by the growing darkness. Only Tyson can stop Brooklyn before it's too late. Summoning his own formidable power from Dragoon, Tyson flies into the sky to convince Brooklyn to cease the negative emotions that are causing the havoc. When reasoning fails, the pair continues their battle above the ever-crumbling city. The tide turns in Tyson's favor when he's able to summon the spirits of his teammates' blades and merge them with Dragoon, which evolves into the most powerful Beyblade ever. By probing deeper into Brooklyn's psyche, Tyson learns that his foe's anxiety stems from childhood isolation at being a genius so early in life. Tyson makes Brooklyn see that Beyblading is a pure sport to be enjoyed for one reason alone - the love of the game. Brooklyn calms down. The chaos ends. And the pair continues their match simply for enjoyment. With BEGA's HQ in shambles, the upstart league and its owner Boris are ruined. Mr. Dickenson's BBA league restarts, but in a much more modest form. And kids everywhere - including Tyson and his friends - return to the simple, purest form of Beyblading.</p>
